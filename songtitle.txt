Jadugar Saiyan Chhod Mori Baiyan
Duniya Men Hum Aaye Hain
Aaj Phir Jeene Ki Tamanna Hai
Woh Dil Kahan Se Laoon
Shravan Aala Taru Tarula
Natali Chaitrachi Navalai
O Raat Ke Musafir
Pa Lagoon Kar Jori Re Shyam
Khushian Manaye Kyon Na Hum
Har Shau Pe Jawani Hai
Mohan Kyon Nahin Aaye
Bichhde Huye Pardesi
Chupchup Khade Ho Zaroor Koi Baat Hai
Ab Mera Kaun Sahara
Yaad Aanewale Phir Yaad
Aesi Mohabbat Se Ham Baaz Aaye
Nain Mile Nain
Bachpan Ke Din Bhula Na Dena - Duet

Din Suhane Mausam Bahar Ka
Jhoole Mein Pawan Ki Aai Bahar

Charani Tava Magate
Kaise Katoon Ye Kali Raten
Tere Dil Mein Zara Si Jagah
Gori Sakhiyon Se Ankhiyan
Jo Dil Mein Khushi Ban Kar Aai
Na Woh Ham Se Juda Honge
Dil Ne Phir Yaad Kiya
Zulm Tumhare Sah Na Sake
Tujhe Woh Bewafa
Na Umeed Ho Ke Bhi
Hoton Pe Hansi Dil Mein Hai Khushi
Tu Kaun Hai Mera
Dil Ka Dard Na Jane Duniya
Madbhare Pawan Mein
